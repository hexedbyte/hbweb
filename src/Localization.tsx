        rtodesc: 'A red team operator is a skilled professional in the field of cybersecurity tasked with simulating real-world attacks on an organization\'s systems, networks, and infrastructure. Unlike traditional cybersecurity professionals who defend against such attacks (blue team), red team operators adopt the perspective of an adversary, employing advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors. Essentially, they act as ethical hackers, helping organizations to proactively strengthen their defenses by uncovering potential security gaps before they can be exploited by real threats.',
